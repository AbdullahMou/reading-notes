# Whiteboard Interview

## The Advice

* The best piece of technical interview advice I have received and can impart upon you is to communicate

## Communicate

### Restate the Question

* The interview should give you affirmation or, perhaps, your understanding is incorrect and they will help you understand.
* There is no situation in which restating the problem will hurt you — it shows you can articulate a problem and gives you time to think it through a bit while you discuss.
* Furthermore, starting the discussion this way will help quell some nerves that might otherwise manifest while trying to solve the actual challenge

### Ask About Edge Cases

* It’s still not time to dive right into coding the solution. Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem.
* Ask about them. In many cases, the interviewer hasn’t even thought about edge cases and will make something up. 

### Ask About Test Cases

* This is free and you should take advantage of it.
* Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass

### Pseudocode

* If your pseudocode looks good but you end up having difficulty translating it to actual code

### Actual Code

* You should now convert your pseudocode into actual code.
