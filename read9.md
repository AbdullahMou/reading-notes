## What is Dunder Method

* In Python, special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores

* As it quickly became tiresome to say under-under-method-under-under Pythonistas adopted the term “dunder methods”, a short form of “double under.”

* These “dunders” or “special methods” in Python are also sometimes called “magic methods.” But using this terminology can make them seem more complicated than they really are—at the end of the day there’s nothing “magical” about them. You should treat these methods like a normal language feature.

## Special Methods and the Python Data Model

* This elegant design is known as the Python data model and lets developers tap into rich language features like sequences, iteration, operator overloading, attribute access


## Enriching a Simple Account Class

* Throughout this article I will enrich a simple Python class with various dunder methods to unlock the following language features:
  *  Initialization of new objects
  *  Object representation
  *  Enable iteration
  *  Operator overloading (comparison)
  *  Operator overloading (addition)
  *  Method invocation
  *  Context manager support (with statement)



## Probability

* At the most basic level, probability seeks to answer the question, “What is the chance of an event happening?” An event is some outcome of interest. To calculate the chance of an event happening, we also need to consider all the other events that can occur. The quintessential representation of probability is the humble coin toss. In a coin toss the only events that can happen are:

  * Flipping a heads
  * Flipping a tails

##  From statistics to probability
* Our data will be generated by flipping a coin 10 times and counting how many times we get heads. We will call a set of 10 coin tosses a trial. Our data point will be the number of heads we observe. We may not get the “ideal” 5 heads, but we won’t worry too much since one trial is only one data point. If we perform many, many trials, we expect the average number of heads over all of our trials to approach the 50%. The code below simulates 10, 100, 1000, and 1000000 trials, and then calculates the average proportion of heads observed. Our process is summarized in the image below as well.

## The data and the distribution

* Before we can tackle the question of “which wine is better than average,” we have to mind the nature of our data. Intuitively, we’d like to use the scores of the wines to compare groups, but there comes a problem: the scores usually fall in a range. How do we compare groups of scores between types of wines and know with some degree of certainty that one is better than the other? Enter the normal distribution. The normal distribution refers to a particularly important phenomenon in the realm of probability and statistics.
