**libraries**
* The first step is to import the required Python libraries into Ipython Notebook.

**sklearn**
* This data set is available in sklearn Python module

* import Boston data set into Ipython notebook and store it in a variable called boston
* The object boston is a dictionary, so you can explore the keys of this dictionary.
*  print the feature names of boston data set

**convert**
* convert boston.data into a pandas data frame.

## Fitting a Linear Model

* use all parameters to fit a linear regression model

# Predicting Prices

* calculate the predicted prices (Y^i) using lm.predict.
* display the housing prices. These are my predicted housing prices.

# Training validation data sets

* implement linear regression on the entire data set
* split the data sets into training and test data sets.
