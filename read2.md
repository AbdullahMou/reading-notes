* Arrange: you need to organize the data needed to execute that piece of code (input)
* Act: here you will execute the code being tested (exercise the behaviour)
* Assert: after executing the code, you will check if the result (output) is the same as you were expecting

### The Cycle

* The cycle is made by three steps:
  * Write a unit test and make it fail
  * Write the feature and make the test pass
  * Refactor the code — the first version doesn’t need to be the beautiful one
