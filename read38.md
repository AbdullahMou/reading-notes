# React

## Conditional Rendering

* Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript.

### Element Variables

* You can use variables to store elements. This can help you conditionally render a part of the component while the rest of the output doesn’t change.

## Preventing Component from Rendering

* In rare cases you might want a component to hide itself even though it was rendered by another component.
* To do this return null instead of its render output.

## Lists and Keys

* In React, transforming arrays into lists of elements is nearly identical.

## Thinking in React

* One of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them.
* In this document, we’ll walk you through the thought process of building a searchable product data table using React.

* Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy

* Build A Static Version in React
* Identify The Minimal Representation Of UI State
* Identify Where Your State Should Live
* Add Inverse Data Flow
